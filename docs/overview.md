This mini–project is a basic command-line calculator built using Python.
It performs four main arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The project was created as part of the Computer Science Fundamentals & Career Pathways assignment to help us understand how real development works using VS Code, Git, and GitHub.

Instead of just writing code, this assignment helped me learn the complete workflow of a software project—
from creating files, writing functions, organizing code properly, version controlling with Git, and finally hosting it on GitHub.
