Although the current version of the calculator works well for basic mathematical operations, there are many ways it can be improved in the future. As I continue learning more programming concepts, I plan to extend the project in the following ways:

1. Add More Mathematical Operations

Right now, the calculator only supports four basic operations.
In future versions, I can add:

Square root

Power function

Percentage

Modulo

Factorial

Average / mean

This will make the calculator more useful and closer to a real scientific calculator.

2. Add a Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Currently, the calculator works only in the terminal.
Using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt, I can create:

Buttons for numbers

A display screen

A cleaner layout

This will make the calculator look like a real Windows/Mac calculator app.

3. Add Input Validation

Right now, the program assumes the user enters correct input.
In the future, I can add:

Error messages for invalid numbers

Re-asking for input instead of stopping the program

Handling wrong menu choices more smoothly

This improves the overall user experience.

4. Add a History Feature

I can store previous results so the user can see all calculations done in one session.
This can be done by:

Using a list

Writing to a text file

Displaying the history at the end

5. Convert It Into a Multi-File Project

As the program grows, I can separate:

Math functions into one file

Main program into another file

Utility tools into a third file

This will make the project more organized and professional.

6. Add Unit Testing

Using Python’s unittest module, I can write tests for each function.
This will ensure the calculator works correctly even after adding more features.
